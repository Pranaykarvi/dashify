# TIMELINE-:
## Month 1: Planning and Foundation
### Week 1–2: Define the Scope
- Finalize the core features (e.g., file upload, criteria selection, visualization types).
- Define user roles (e.g., basic users, premium users with extra features).
- Create wireframes/mockups of the user interface.
### Week 3–4: Set Up the Development Environment & Chatbot
- Choose tech stack (React.js for frontend, Python Flask/Django for backend).
- Set up version control (e.g., GitHub).
- Begin building the chatbot:
- Implement chatbot functionality using libraries like Dialogflow, Rasa, or Botpress.
- Integrate the chatbot into a simple web page.
- Be ready with the chatbot within the first month Duration 
#
## Month 2: Backend Development
### Week 1–2: CSV Handling
- Implement secure file upload and storage (e.g., AWS S3, local storage for dev).
- Parse CSV files using libraries like Pandas (Python) or CSV-parser (Node.js).
- Validate uploaded data and handle errors (e.g., incorrect format, missing data).
### Week 3–4: Data Processing
- Build a backend API for data preprocessing (e.g., aggregation, filtering).
- Add logic for criteria selection:
  - Filters (e.g., date range, category selection).
  - Aggregations (e.g., sum, average).
- Start integrating data processing logic with visualization options.
#
## Month 3: Frontend Development
### Week 1–2: Visualization Interface
- Build a dynamic dashboard layout using React or Vue.js.
- Integrate a chart library (e.g., Plotly) for rendering visualizations.
- Fetch processed data from the backend and display it.
### Week 3–4: Dashboard Features
- Add user options for selecting chart types and customizing layouts.
- Enable users to drag, resize, and rearrange visualizations on the dashboard.
- Implement real-time updates when users modify criteria or re-upload files.
#
## Month 4: Advanced Features and Testing
### Week 1: Advanced Visualizations
- Add support for complex charts (e.g., heatmaps, combined charts).
- Enable interactivity in charts (e.g., zoom, hover, drill-downs).
### Week 2: Export and Sharing
- Implement export functionality (PDF, PNG, or downloadable CSV of processed data).
- Allow users to share dashboards via links or embed codes.
### Week 3: User Accounts and Cloud Integration
- Add user authentication (e.g., email/password, social logins).
- Integrate cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive) for data uploads.
### Week 4: Testing
- Conduct unit testing for backend and frontend components.
- Test the platform with various CSV datasets to handle edge cases.
- Ensure responsiveness on mobile devices and different browsers.
#
## Month 5: Finalization and Launch
### Week 1–2: Optimization
- Optimize dashboard performance for large datasets.
- Add caching for frequently used visualizations.
- Fine-tune UI/UX based on feedback.
### Week 3: Deployment
- Deploy the website on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, Vercel).
- Set up monitoring for performance and errors (e.g., Google Analytics, Sentry).
### Week 4: Launch and Marketing
- Create a landing page showcasing your platform's features.
- Share with beta users for feedback.
- Promote via social media, forums, or targeted ads.
- Post-Launch: Continuous Improvement
- Gather user feedback and fix issues promptly.
- Introduce new features (e.g., AI insights, integrations).
- Offer premium subscriptions for advanced features.
